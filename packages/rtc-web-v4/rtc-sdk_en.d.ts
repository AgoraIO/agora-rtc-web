     * **DEPRECATED** from v4.6.0. Use [[onAutoplayFailed]] instead.
     *
     * If multiple tracks call `play` and all trigger autoplay blocking, the SDK triggers `onAudioAutoplayFailed` multiple times.
     *
     * The autoplay failure is caused by browsers' [autoplay blocking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide#Autoplay_and_autoplay_blocking), which does not affect video tracks.
     *
     * In the Agora Web SDK, once the user has interacted with the webpage, the autoplay blocking is removed. You can deal with the issue in either of the following ways:
     * - If you do not want to receive the `onAudioAutoplayFailed` callback, ensure that the user has interacted with the webpage before `RemoteAudioTrack.play` or `LocalAudioTrack.play` is called.
     * - If you cannot guarantee a user interaction before the call of `RemoteAudioTrack.play` or `LocalAudioTrack.play`, you can display a button and instruct the user to click it in the `onAudioAutoplayFailed` callback.
     *

     *
     * Different from [[onAudioAutoplayFailed]], if multiple tracks call `play` and all trigger autoplay blocking, the SDK triggers `onAutoplayFailed` only once before a user gesture for removing the autoplay blocking occurs.
     *
     * The autoplay failure of audible media is caused by browsers' [autoplay blocking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide#Autoplay_and_autoplay_blocking). On most web browsers, inaudible media are not affected by autoplay blocking. However, on iOS Safari with low power mode enabled, or other iOS in-app browsers that implement a custom autoplay policy, such as WeChat browser, the autoplay of inaudible media is blocked.
     *
     * In the Agora Web SDK, once the user has interacted with the webpage, the autoplay blocking is removed. You can deal with the issue in either of the following ways:
     * - If you do not want to receive the `onAutoplayFailed` callback, ensure that the user has interacted with the webpage before `RemoteTrack.play` or `LocalTrack.play` is called.

     * - For low-security requirements: You can use the temporary token generated at Console. For details, see [Get an RTC temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#generate-an-rtc-temporary-token).
     * - For high-security requirements: Set it as the token generated at your server. For details, see [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/token_server?platform=Web).
     * @param channel A string that provides a unique channel name for the call. The length must be within 64 bytes. Supported character scopes:
     * - All lowercase English letters: a to z.
     * - All uppercase English letters: A to Z.
     * - All numeric characters: 0 to 9.
     * - The space character.

     * @param uid The user ID, an integer or a string, ASCII characters only. Ensure this ID is unique. If you set the `uid` to `null`, the Agora server assigns a number uid and returns it in the Promise object.
     * - If you use a number as the user ID, it should be a 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 0 to (2<sup>32</sup>-1).
     * - If you use a string as the user ID, the maximum length is 255 characters.
